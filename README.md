## 📌 Project Overview
Diabetes is a growing global health concern, and early detection plays a crucial role in prevention and management.  
This project uses machine learning techniques to assess diabetes risk based on patient health indicators such as glucose level, BMI, age, blood pressure, and family history.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**
- Total records: 768
- Target variable: `Outcome`
  - 1 → Diabetic
  - 0 → Non-Diabetic

---

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing
- Identified medically invalid zero values in features like glucose, insulin, blood pressure, and BMI
- Treated zero values as missing data
- Applied **median imputation**, which is suitable for healthcare datasets

---

## 🧠 Feature Engineering
- BMI categorized into Underweight, Normal, Overweight, and Obese
- Age grouped into risk-based categories
- Glucose levels categorized into Normal, Prediabetes, and Diabetes ranges
- Categorical features encoded using one-hot encoding

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes**

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation
Evaluation metrics used:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

### Key Insight:
- Logistic Regression provides balanced accuracy
- Naive Bayes achieves very high recall for diabetic patients
- In medical screening, recall is prioritized to minimize false negatives

  🎯 Why Recall Matters More Than Accuracy in Medical AI

In medical risk assessment, recall is more critical than accuracy.
A false negative means a diabetic patient is incorrectly classified as healthy, which can delay diagnosis and treatment.

Logistic Regression provides balanced performance with reasonable accuracy.

Naive Bayes achieves very high recall for diabetic patients, meaning it rarely misses actual diabetes cases.

➡ For early-stage diabetes screening, a model with higher recall is preferred, even if overall accuracy is lower.

🩺 Key Health Insights from the Model

High glucose levels are the strongest indicator of diabetes risk.

BMI and obesity category significantly increase diabetes probability.

Age above 35 shows higher risk, especially when combined with high BMI.

Insulin irregularities strongly correlate with positive diabetes outcomes.

Patients with multiple moderate risk factors can still be classified as high-risk, highlighting the need for early screening.

➡ These insights demonstrate how machine learning can support preventive healthcare decisions, not replace doctors.

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in healthcare with a strong focus on data preprocessing, feature engineering, and medically relevant evaluation metrics.  
Naive Bayes is preferred for early-stage diabetes risk screening due to its high recall.
