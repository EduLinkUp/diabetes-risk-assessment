## 📌 Project Overview
Diabetes is a growing global health concern, and early detection plays a crucial role in prevention and management.  
This project uses machine learning techniques to assess diabetes risk based on patient health indicators such as glucose level, BMI, age, blood pressure, and family history.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**
- Total records: 768
- Target variable: `Outcome`
  - 1 → Diabetic
  - 0 → Non-Diabetic

---

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing
- Identified medically invalid zero values in features like glucose, insulin, blood pressure, and BMI
- Treated zero values as missing data
- Applied **median imputation**, which is suitable for healthcare datasets

---

## 🧠 Feature Engineering
- BMI categorized into Underweight, Normal, Overweight, and Obese
- Age grouped into risk-based categories
- Glucose levels categorized into Normal, Prediabetes, and Diabetes ranges
- Categorical features encoded using one-hot encoding

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes**

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation
Evaluation metrics used:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

### Key Insight:
- Logistic Regression provides balanced accuracy
- Naive Bayes achieves very high recall for diabetic patients
- In medical screening, recall is prioritized to minimize false negatives

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in healthcare with a strong focus on data preprocessing, feature engineering, and medically relevant evaluation metrics.  
Naive Bayes is preferred for early-stage diabetes risk screening due to its high recall.
